# MDP Project 27: Linux Firewall Application Based on the Microsoft Threat Management Gateway

Done:
- Frontend of Login page
- Frontend of the networking page basics must do also :
	- Cell selection with customized right click options for all pages
	- Row ordering for All Firewall Policy, Web Access Policy, Network Rules
	- Check if some tables need fixing in the styling for all pages
	- Add Search bar above the tables (Most probably will be inserted in the Networking page so i dont render it on each tab like i did with the tabs)
	- Add toolbar at the top based on each page

What to do:
- Copy the Frontend of the Networking page onto the other pages.
